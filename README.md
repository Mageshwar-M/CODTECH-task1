project name:SIMPLE CALCULATOR
     For this simple calculator program, here are the **objective**, **key activities**, and **technology used**:

Objective:
The goal is to create a basic calculator program that allows the user to perform simple arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) between two numbers.

 Key Activities:
1. **User Input**: 
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
   - Prompt the user to select an arithmetic operation.
   
2. **Processing**:
   - Based on the user's selection, perform the chosen arithmetic operation.
   - Handle special cases, such as checking for division by zero.

3. **Output**:
   - Display the calculated result to the user.
   - Provide error messages for invalid operations or division by zero.

 Technology Used:
1. **Programming Language**: Python
   - Chosen for its simplicity, readability, and suitability for basic scripting tasks.
   
2. **Built-in Functions**:
   - `input()`: To capture user input.
   - `print()`: To display messages and results.

3. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   - Basic operators: `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, and `/` for division.

This program is a foundational example that introduces core programming concepts like user input, conditional logic, error handling, and basic arithmetic.
